   * See `UnitSequencer` for a high-level explanation of Sequencer semantics.
   *
   * A UnitSequencer which reports its sequence summed with the sequences
   * of its internal collection of sequencers.
   *
   * This device is useful for tracking the state of data comprised from multiple
   * sources. For instance, you might have CachingDataStore(A) storing data
   * from Source(A), tracked by Sequencer(A), and CachingDataStore(B) storing
   * data from Source(B), tracked by Sequencer(B). Meanwhile, you may have
   * CachingDataStore(C), storing data from Source(A + B), and tracked by
   * Sequencer(C) = Sequencer(A + B) - a DelegatingCompositeSequencer.
   *
   * Thus, if Sequencer(A) is advanced, it may invalidate CachingDataStore(A) or
   * CachingDataStore(C) or both.
   *
   * Note this particular usage is generally only useful for Unit sequencers.
   *
   * If you'd like the above functionality, but with Sequencer(A) and
   * Sequencer(B) as ClockSequencers, and Sequencer(C) merely tracking
   * modification, you'd need to use a DelegatingForwardingSequencer for A and B,
   * forwarding them to UnitSequencer(C).
   *
   * DelegatingCompositeSequencer and DelegatingForwardingSequencer are effectivly
   * opposites of each other. DelegatingCompositeSequencer composes the `value`
   * of multiple underlying sequencers (pull), and DelegatingForwardingSequencer
   * forwards the `advance` call to multiple targets (push).
